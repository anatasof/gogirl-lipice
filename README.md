Flip is a timed card memory game. When starting a level, there's a red bar on top of the screen that shows how much time you have left.
Click the green cards to see what symbol they uncover and try to find the matching symbol underneath the other cards.
Uncover two matching symbols in a row to eliminate them from the game.
Eliminate all cards as fast as you can to win the game. Have fun FLIPing!
